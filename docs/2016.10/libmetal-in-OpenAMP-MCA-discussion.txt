# OpenAMP MCA Working Group Meeting -- libmetal in OpenAMP 2016-05-19

## libmetal overview

### Motivation

* Remove OS/Compiler specific details form OpenAMP repo
* Implement OpenAMP libraries in Linux user space
  * Implement the full rpmsg/virtio in Linux user space
  * Remain backwards compatible with Linux kernel implementation
* Users can use libemtal APIs to build their specialized AMP solution

### libmetal APIs Overview
* APIs provided by libmetal are put into the README of libmetal repo


## Concerns on libmetal
* Petr: footprint size and complexity for RTOS
  * Cyril: libmetal is very thin, it should not increase the size of the code in RTOS
* Petr: Since it out of the OpenAMP repo,
  the complexity and size may increase as more support is added to libmetal
  * Cyril: It is under OpenAMP opensource project.
           It is mainly for OpenAMP.
           We do not force other software stack to use libmetal.
           We move the env layer in the OpenAMP to libmetal, and provides an option to user.

## Next
* Continue to complete APIs in libmetal for RTOS/bare-metal
* Continue to port OpenAMP on libmetal

## Misc
* Petr and Marek: rpmsg protocol was out sufficiently defined outside of the actual implementation.
  Propose to discuss the protocol.
